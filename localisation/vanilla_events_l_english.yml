    vanilla_italy.2.d:0 "Defiant to the last, King Zog has rejected our ultimatum. He and his advisors are now trying to scrape together whatever pitiful defenses Albania can muster. We must occupy Tirana and put an end to this farce!"
    vanilla_italy.2.a:0 "We could have done this the easy way, Zog!"
    vanilla_italy.3.t:0 "Italian Ultimatum"
    vanilla_italy.3.d:0 "Italian diplomats have presented an ultimatum to us demanding that we submit to their occupation! Albania is to be ruled in a personal union under the Italian king!"
    vanilla_italy.3.a:0 "We must submit."
    vanilla_italy.3.b:0 "It shall not come to pass! Rally to Zog!"

    vanilla_italy.4.d:0 "Engineers from the Regio Esercito have studied our northern frontier and identified the locations where the Vallo Alpino needs to be strengthened and expanded. The necessary build orders have already been issued."

    vanilla_italy.7.a:0 "We best look out for ourselves from now on"
    vanilla_italy.8.t:0 "Join the French faction."
    vanilla_italy.8.d:0 "Mouvement Franciste is gaining ground in France and has asked us to join their faction. Does this further the interests of Italy?"
    vanilla_italy.8.a:0 "Let us join the French."
    vanilla_italy.8.b:0 "The French are not to be trusted"
    vanilla_italy.9.t:0 "Request Balearic Islands from Spain"
    vanilla_italy.9.d:0 "During the civil war, Italy offered volunteers to fight for the nationalist cause. Although ideological motivations were paramount, Italy also had a strategic stake in the outcome. The defense of the Balearic Islands, especially Majorca, was of special interest to Italy due to their position in the Mediterranean Sea, especially in relation to west European colonies.\n\nNow, [From.GetLeader] has suggested the islands to be transferred to Italian control permanently. Considering their contribution to our victory, there may be merits to the suggestions."
    vanilla_italy.9.a:0 "Let the Italians keep what they defended."
    vanilla_italy.9.b:0 "We did not win this war to bow to foreign demands!"
    vanilla_italy.10.t:0 "Spain Gives Up Balearic Islands"
    vanilla_italy.10.d:0 "Thankful of our support and defense of the fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War, [From.GetLeader] has agreed to make our temporary military installations on Majorca, Minorca and Ibiza permanent. Although these islands with their important strategic position are a welcome addition to our empire, it seems the Spaniards now consider the debt repaid."
    vanilla_italy.10.a:0 "As long as they acknowledge us as the rightful owners."
    vanilla_italy.11.t:0 "Spain Refuses to Give Up Islands"
    vanilla_italy.11.d:0 "Despite the aid we gave them in the civil war, [From.GetLeader] has now refused to give us the Balearic Islands, which our countrymen fought to defend. Although they insist that they seek to maintain good relations with our nation, making us withdraw the military installations that kept these islands Spanish in the first place is a slight we won't forget."
    vanilla_italy.11.a:0 "If the need arises, we might claim them anyway."
    vanilla_italy.12.t:0 "London Conference"
    vanilla_italy.12.d:0 "Our friends in Yugoslavia have come under pressure from our northern neighbor. The corrupt and decadent western powers have shown why they are fading away by failing to stand up for the rights of Yugoslavia. This could be exactly the opening for a younger, more dynamic power who has the right leadership to stride purposely upon the world stage! The Commando Supremo reports they are almost ready to unleash our invincible legions."
    vanilla_italy.12.a:0 "This is our time!"
    vanilla_italy.12.b:0 "There will be a better opportunity."
    vanilla_italy.13.t:0 "First Ljubljana Award"
    vanilla_italy.13.d_dalmatia_montenegro:0 "As the Yugoslav state collapses under its own contradictions it is time for Italy to take her due. The fading powers in the West may be so afraid of Italy that they will deny her due but new powers are rising who see Italy's true worth. Not only have we secured what was denied to us in the Mutilated Victory but our protectorate of Albania has seen its territory grow too."
    vanilla_italy.13.d_montenegro:0 "Our decision to align with the rising power of Germany has paid off. The Yugoslav state is heading for dissolution and the German leadership has the foresight to see the benefits of Italian friendship. Montenegro will be passed to Albania as is only right"
    vanilla_italy.13.d_dalmatia:0 "After the betrayal of our former allies in the west at the Paris peace conference, where we were promised northern Dalmatia, we chose to align ourselves with Berlin. Germany has wisely judged that Italian friendship is too valuable to ignore and our claims in Yugoslavia are to be recognised. The Adriatic will be an Italian lake and justice will be done."
    vanilla_italy.13.a:0 "Italy Rises"
    vanilla_italy.14.t:0 "Germany Thwarts our Demands"
    vanilla_italy.14.d:0 "Germany has seen fit to thwart our modest, fair and reasonable demands for Vichy territory. Should we leave [From.GetFactionName]?"
    vanilla_italy.14.a:0 "Unacceptable. We can do better alone"
    vanilla_italy.14.b:0 "We will earn their respect"
    vanilla_italy.15.t:0 "Germany Supports our Demands"
    vanilla_italy.15.d:0 "Germany has seen the wisdom of supporting our demands for Vichy territory. Vichy has surrendered Savoy and Corsica to us."
    vanilla_italy.15.d_Corsica:0 "With a small amount of Germany support Vichy has surrendered Corsica to us"
    vanilla_italy.15.a:0 "Revenge for Italy"
    vanilla_italy.16.t:0 "Germany Almost Supports Us"
    vanilla_italy.16.d:0 "Germany has seen fit to meddle in our dispute with Vichy France. They have blocked our attempt to gain Corsica but we still have Savoy."
    vanilla_italy.16.a:0 "The Corsica Question has only been Postponed"
