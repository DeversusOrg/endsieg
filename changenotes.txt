### STEAM DESCRIPTION ###

[i]This is the official successor to the GÃ¶tterdammerung 1944 Mod. Anyone else claiming to be or uploading a former/older version of this mod (Gotterdammerung 1944) is doing so without Endsieg's consent. If you have any questions, suggestions or want to become a dev we redirect you to our [url=https://discord.gg/6FA6qS2]Discord[/url].
If you would be so kind, this is my (MisterJay) [url=https://www.patreon.com/ThatMisterJay] Patreon[/url]. I currently do not have a steady source of income, and might have to give up modding if I can't find it through Patreon. Your support would be highly appreciated.[/i]

Current supported HOI4 version: 1.10.4
Current update: 2.5.8

Endsieg is German for "Ultimate Victory", this term was commonly used in WWI and WWII propaganda and was one of the most widely used terms in propaganda by the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels would still come to use this term as late as 1945 ensuring German's that they were facing a "final victory".

This mod is the successor to the outdated Endsieg mod and Goetterdaemmerung, however much different than some might remember it. The scenarios currently implemented are: 1910, 1916, 1914, 1918, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1944 december and 1945.


[h1][b]Scenarios[/b][/h1]
[b]1910, 1914, 1916 (soon) and 1918: WW1[/b]
Endsieg features a fully implemented WW1 scenario. You can start on the buildup to the war, just before the war, get into action in the middle or close to the end of the war.

[b]July 2nd, 1941: Operation Barbarossa[/b]
With the start of Operation Barbarossa on the 22nd of June 1941, Germany has officialy broken the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The first phase was the first and only attack along the entire frontline, and captured a huge stroke of USSR territories. The German army seems unstoppable and the Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 4,000 Soviet Aircraft while only losing 80 of their own. Libya is still holding strong and so far the Soviets seem unable to resist the German Panzers. Japan stands poised to attack the allies in the Pacific...

[b]August 1st, 1942: The Battle of Stalingrad[/b]
After a harsh winter in the first war of the eastern campaign the German Army continued their offensive but with a different objective. The oil fields in the Caucasus. On its way is the strategically important city Stalingrad. For Stalin, the city has an important role. The Soviets will not give up the city easily. That's clear.

[b]July 11th, 1943: The Turning Tide[/b]
The Battle of Kursk starting July 5th, 1943, would become one of the largest tank battles in history and would ultimately force Germany after its evetual defeat to stay on the defensive on the Eastern Front for the rest of the war. Called "Operation Citadel" its purpose was to cut off the Kursk Salient/Bulge to prevent further Soviet Offensives by (hopefully) encircling large amounts of Soviet forces in the salient/bulge. In Italy the allies have recently landed in Sicily and are attempting to push into mainland Italy, the Italian government is ever so barely lingering on the side of the Axis with an inner struggle going on. In the Pacific, the Japanese Empire has reached its zenith and is now starting to fall back.

[b]June 21, 1944: Goetterdaemmerung[/b]
The Allies have just landed in Normandy two weeks prior and on the east the Soviet Steamroller is pushing full speed ahead sparing none mercy crushing anything and anyone in its way, Germany is not on its knees yet holding a great deal of territory and resources but its time is short. Its allies are giving up hope, their people weary of continuing the war, Italy has switched sides and now all that remains is the northern half puppet state, the Italian Social Republic headed by Il Duce, Mussolini. In the Pacific, the United States is slowly approaching Mainland Japan as the war situation free falls for Japan.

[b]December 16, 1944: Kamp fur das Vaterland[/b]
The German Reich is being pushed back heavily from all directions, the Allies in the West took back all of France, and Belgium, and are now dangerously close to breaking through and infiltrating the heart of the Reich itself, in the east the Russians are still quite a way behind the Oder River but the front has extended greatly and our ally Romania has surrendered with Hungary dangerously close. Italy is at a standstill and in Asia, the situation for Japan is not getting any better with the United States invading the Philippines and the Japanese Navy being a shell of its former past.

[b]March 20, 1945: Endsieg[/b]
Aided by air blows which paralyzed communications throughout the length and breadth of Germany, the Allied Armies have surged across the Cologne Plain. To the south, other forces drove eastward through the rugged Eifel along the Moselle River. Dashing to seize a usable bridge overlooked by the enemy, United States troops crossed the broad river at Remagen. In the Saar, a coordinated offensive was launched to destroy the remaining German forces west of the Rhine. The Russian Bear is pushing without anyone being able to stop them.n\n The war is coming to a close but Germany is far from surrendering with Goebbels reportedly saying that "Endsieg is near" on the radio".

Endsieg features a variety of things besides the scenarios to give more depth and more accuracy to the game.

[h1]Reworked AI:[/h1]

AI has been reworked to the greatest extent, we do not promise amazing AI, we just tried to fix it up as much as we could, the rest is up to the developers.

[h1]Historical Accuracy:[/h1]

Endsieg adds two new types of equipment, Rations and Fuel. Rations are needed for soldiers in addition to weapons to keep them at full strength and for this you need the grain resource, whilst Armored Vehicles require the Fuel resource which is made with1 Oil, this is more realistic essentially and will more clearly represent the German struggle with Fuel at times.

[h1]A New Tech Tree[/h1]

Made Primarily for the 1918 scenario we also added some more things in general to the Tech Tree to add more flavour to the game and we will be continuously producing and adding more content to the tech tree with time, feel free to give suggestions if you would like to see something added!

[img]https://i.imgur.com/MEeThuE.png[/img]

Because Endsieg adds more provinces, a new tech tree, amongst many other things it will most likely not be compatible with many mods that rework such areas. Mods that are compatible without a doubt however will be that of gfx.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/b13dug6.png[/img]

We are currently working on majorly expanding WW1 and interwar. Do note that the current developers all go to University and do not have a lot of time on their hands. I would also like to expand on the scenarios, I know people have asked for a 1945 March scenario or something like that with the battle of Berlin, others have asked for 1942 Scenario. I will be adding scenarios with time.

[h1]Future Scenarios:[/h1]

These scenarios are planned for the future, in decreasing order of importance:

1919: The Red Scare
1947/8: Postwar, alternative German victory scenario

[h1]Tech Tree:[/h1]

We plan to expand the tech tree slowly to include a variety of news technologies to add more depth to the game. Currently the tech tree (thanks to the fellows @RT56) expands until 1956 for most technologies, so this should allow for a long period of gameplay.

[h1]Minors Depth:[/h1]

We eventually want to expand on minor nations such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Finland, Yugoslavia, etc and make them more unique nations with events of their own and ministers.

[General]
Endsieg's music is now a separate mod, to lower file space! You can find the new music mod here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544621441
Improved game stability
Some massive text walls made smaller (looking at you Red Baron)
Resources strip looking weird fixed
New States in Arabia, and Austria (Burgenland)
Player commands no longer take more planning (this is retarded and promotes not micro'ing your divisions which is impossible in Endsieg)
Bicycle divisions now have a mesh
More leaders now have proper stats, still working to complete
Fixed a bunch of wrong spellings of U.S. among other things
Persia now changes its name to Iran in 1936+
Less events at the beginning of the game, all merged into one (except welcome event) to reduce clutter.
Egypt now exists as a country, to correctly portray the nation, and should make Ottoman job a bit harder in 1910-1914.
African cores removed for a whole lot of countries
Fixes to GUI in political, construction and production view
Less special forces for each country
A lot of duplicate GFX removed, reducing file size.

Countless tags merged. This does mean some countries will have mistakes (like generals that died still living), which we would be glad to hear about in our bugs section.
Added tooltips for Industrialisation focuses.
Lower levels of industrialisation aren't as bad
Weird state names fixed (looking at you east and west Lodz)
Airplanes have been changed. They now cost double the production, have double the stats, and the already existing airwings have been cut in half. Airbases can only hold 100 per base as well. This is to reduce lag, as airwings would greatly influence game speed in 1945+.
You should no longer be at war with non-existent countries.
War exhaustion now goes down if you are at peace
You can now enable war exhaustion for other countries
Early motorized is now a thing, and is slightly slower and higher production cost than normal motorized
You no longer need fuel (the equipment) for army and air.

Generic portraits for generic leaders
New models for several equipments
Lots of fixes to localisation for advisors

[Map]
Middle east now has a greatly improved map
Africa has a greatly improved map
Greek and Bulgarian states massively improved
Germany now has a bunch more states in the Rhineland for Interwar.
French states have been improved
Polish states have been improved
More states to accurately portray WW2 peacedeal and microstates, the latter are yet to be added.

[Ideologies]
National Socialism is gone. Only countries using it were Germany and Vichy France, it just led to problems. Bye bye!
Left Wing Radicalism has been integrated into our other communist ideologies. It filled a niche, but its not big enough to justify the maintenance. Bye bye!
Several ideologies have had changes to their stats. Populism for example can justify slightly slower than Fascism now.

[WWI]
WW1 army doctrine is now less effective, and Post GW has been made less bad too.
Don Kuban republic and Soviet Republic now implemented
Austria is no longer called the Austrian Empire after Villa Giusti armistice
Fixed Soviet missing cores
Kaiserslacht should now whitepeace everyone
Improvements on Italo Turkish war
Improvements on Mexican Civil War
UK's improve puppets no longer improves random UK states
Franz Josef dying now properly fires accompanying events
Fixes to Italian focus tree (Senussi focus and others requiring Algiers)
Samoa is now German
Negative reinforce rate on several ideas nerfed (so its better for you), huge positives nerfed too.
German navy nerfed
Soviet Union name is now Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic
German war plans are back to event, you should get it once you are at war
Power to Military now gives a buff to army, and power to kaiser is explained
Serbia now rebels if you have annexed them before you started WW1
Nerfed Austrian industry
Sultanate of Egypt now exists
The Ottomans have more factories in the Balkans, making the land worth more; this should make fighting for it more valuable, and if the balkan countries win they should get a sizeable buff.
Nerfed Austrian industry
Samos is now a separate country until their annexation
Crimean operation localisation has been fixed
Turkish/Italian victory in Libya should no longer fire after the other side has already won
Austria now gains some divisions in Tyrol if Italy attacks them
Trenches in 1918 nerfed for both sides

[WWII]
1936 has been added! Note that not a lot of work has gone into this yet, and isn't our current goal. You *can* play it though.
1945 is now slightly easier to compensate for added difficulty by AI-improvements and other things added in new updates. Get your tryhard boots out!
Vietnam now has a name
Original WTT trees are now in instead of only the historical part
DOD events now added
Soviet no longer gains a huge bunch of equipment in 1943 onwards, instead they gain an idea which massively lowers production cost. Should give you an easier time early, but harder time later.
Erwin Rommel should now be dying properly :'(
Samoa is now New Zealand
Fixes to Finnish division names
Leader portraits for the Netherlands added
Operation Margarethe and Valkyrie no longer happen if the respective countries don't exist or have capitulated.
No more soviet having great patriotic war in 41+
Salazar is no longer a fascist
Endsieg Achieved should no longer be weird in 1944+. You will gain all land until the Urals and your puppets will be restored.
Siege of Dunkirk now is a thing in 1944D+.
